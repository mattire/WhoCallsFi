# WhoCallsFi

An android xamarin project for intercepting incoming calls and showing their origin if data is available, basically done for Finnish users.
Uses the kukasoitti.com site for retreaving information, but can be extended to include other data sources, 
if someone wants to implement them.
Has a bug, crashes once in a while, probably related to android app life cycle.
